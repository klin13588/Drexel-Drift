# Drexel Drift by BBB studios

Drexel Drift is a 3D racing game developed in Unity 3D using car assets modeled in
Blender and tracks built using Unity plugins. 

Each functioning part of the game is programmed using the C-sharp programming language. 

<h2> About BBB Studios <h2>
<p> We are a group of four game-development newbies with no experience in both Untiy and C#. We wanted to challenge ourselves 
and learn new things through our CI102/103 project which is how we ended up developing our game, Drexel Drift. </p>
