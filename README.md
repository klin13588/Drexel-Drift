# Drexel Drift by BBB studios

Drexel Drift is a 3D racing game developed in Unity 3D using car assets modeled in
Blender and tracks built using Unity plugins. 

Each functioning part of the game is programmed using the C-sharp programming language. 

## About BBB Studios

We are a group of four game-development newbies with no experience in both Untiy and C#. We wanted to challenge ourselves and learn new things through our CI102/103 project which is how we ended up developing our game, Drexel Drift.

To be honest, we don't know what BBB means either, hahaha

During the initial development of Drexel Drift between January to June of 2022, we didn't use gitlab to branch and merge the projects; we maintained commits through discord channels and then pushed folders to a portable drive
