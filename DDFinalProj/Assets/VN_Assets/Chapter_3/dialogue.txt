Dude what was that?
There isn't any skeletons under my bed is there?
No funky mushrooms anywhere? What's going on?
That track was so SUS!
Phew I should really get out of bed. It's a beautiful day and I have to return the car.
**The phone rings, mom is calling**
Hey Anthony? How have you been? 
Mom, I have been well. Lately I have been taking Uncle Jay's car for a ride.
However, through some series of events, I met this mechanics girl that offered to fix his car.
Apparently, the car is a little ragged.
In the mean time, they offered me a temporary car
That's great to hear Anthony. Are you ready for school?
Yes mom, I am a bit stressed about it though. After everything that has happened lately...
Oh honey it is okay. I know you're going through a tough time, and you're going to get through this.
I'm sure Uncle Jay is so proud of you.
Yes mom, I will make you proud of me too.
I'm gonna head out now. I want to go on a drive to destress.
Have fun Anthony! Be careful out there.
Goodbye ma.
**Anthony hangs up, and then he calls Jenny to let her know he's coming to pick up the car.
Hey Jen I am on the way to pick up my car.
I've just finished it! Your blinker fluid has been refueled and I did some touch up.
Amazing, thank you so much. I am glad I have you in my life.
Of course man! Anything for you dude.
We're good buds right? This is what friends do.
That's right. I am gonna head out now.                                     
**Anthony enters the car of Jenny's father, and drives towards the mechanics shop**
No matter what happens...
Everything is going to be alright.
There will always be someone looking out for me.
Sometimes in life, things take a turn in the wrong way.
Uncle Jay taught me to get back on track
And race for that finish line
We will meet again.
