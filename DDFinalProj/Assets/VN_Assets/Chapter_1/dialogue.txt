**slowly zones back in** Woah what's happening?
Oh right, I am having my driver's license exam right now. Let's start paying attention to the road.
Phew, that wasn't so bad, it's all thanks to the great practice I had with uncle!
Speaking of which, I should definitely let uncle know! He's gotta be the first person I tell.
That's weird, he usually picks up really fast, maybe that geezer is having his afternoon nap.
Maybe I should take a nap too, I sure am exhausted. I probably wouldn't get the chance to do this much once school begins.
The quarter schedule is gonna be rough.
**sobs** Anthony...
Mom? What's wrong? Are you okay?
I'm so sorry Anthony **sobs**, your uncle...He isn't doing so well...
WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
I don't know...He was in a terrible accident. He's in the ICU...Please come to the hospital...Quick...**sobs**
** Anthony quickly drives to the hospital **
Oh honey you are finally here.
uncle are you alright? Can you see me? It's me, Anthony, I'm here, come on, I'm here to see you.
Oh hey there, I'm not in the best shape here aren't I, thanks for coming by to check up on me.
Of course, I would uncle, I'd do anything to see you...You take it easy now okay?
I'm here now, everything is gonna be alright for you, I'm sure the doctors here can fix you up.
Ah Anthony I might not have long left...Five of my ribs are broken and I don't feel anything beneath my waist.
I'm sorry kiddo...I am glad to have witnessed you grow up to the fine man you are...
No don't say that, you can't go just yet.
Look, uncle Jay! I just got my license today! I got this all thanks to you, I haven't taken you out for a ride yet.
Ah sweet dude, I still remember the day I got my license...I was so excited to show that off.
I am so proud of you, Anthony. I knew you could do it. Oh, right, I also heard from your mom that you got admitted to Drexel last week.
I'm sorry I couldn't get to celebrate that with you.
uncle...Don't say that...
**cough cough** I don't have much time left, let your uncle go out with a bang, will ya?
You see, you are my only grandson, and you're very important to me. I shall give you my most treasured possession.
No you can't do this...I can't take it.
Oh I most definitely can, let me spoil you once in a while.
You can think of this as a congratulatory gift.
Take good care of her, alright? Take her on a ride once in a while, and you can show me your drive...
Oh uncle I will, I promise I will.
** Uncle Jay peacefully passes away on the hospital death bed **
** Several weeks pass, and Anthony goes to Uncle Jay's beloved track **
Should I even take this car out? Do I really deserve to drive Dad's treasured car?
No, what am I saying? I should take the car out for once. I still have not shown uncle my driving yet.
Ahh I remember this, uncle Jay took me here all the time when I was younger. I would always watch him race and he has never once lost a race.
He was such a showoff, he'd always throw his jacket into the crowd at me whenever he wins.
